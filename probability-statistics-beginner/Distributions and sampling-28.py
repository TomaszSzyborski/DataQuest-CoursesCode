## 1. Exploring the data ##

# The first 5 rows of the data.
print(income.head())
lowest_income_county = income["county"][income["median_income"].idxmin()]

high_pop = income[income["pop_over_25"] > 500000]

## 2. Random numbers ##

import random

# Returns a random integer between the numbers 0 and 10, inclusive.
num = random.randint(0, 10)

# Generate a sequence of 10 random numbers between the values of 0 and 10.
random_sequence = [random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(10)]

# Sometimes, when we generate a random sequence, we want it to be the same sequence whenever the program is run.
# An example is when you use random numbers to select a subset of the data, and you want other people
# looking at the same data to get the same subset.
# We can ensure this by setting a random seed.
# A random seed is an integer that is used to "seed" a random number generator.
# After a random seed is set, the numbers generated after will follow the same sequence.
random.seed(10)
print([random.randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)])
random.seed(10)
# Same sequence as above.
print([random.randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)])
random.seed(11)
# Different seed means different sequence.
print([random.randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)])
random.seed(20)
new_sequence = [random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(10)]

## 3. Selecting items from a list ##

# Let's say that we have some data on how much shoppers spend in a store.
shopping = [300, 200, 100, 600, 20]

# We want to sample the data, and only select 4 elements.

random.seed(1)
shopping_sample = random.sample(shopping, 4)

# 4 random items from the shopping list.
print(shopping_sample)

## 4. Population vs sample ##

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# A function that returns the result of a die roll.
def roll():
    return random.randint(1, 6)

random.seed(1)
small_sample = [roll() for _ in range(10)]

# Plot a histogram with 6 bins (1 for each possible outcome of the die roll)
plt.hist(small_sample, 6)
plt.show()
random.seed(1)
medium_sample = [roll() for _ in range(100)]

plt.hist(medium_sample, 6)
plt.show()

## 7. Sampling counties ##

    return mean_median_sample_incomes

plt.show()

# What you're seeing above is the result of biased sampling.
# Instead of selecting randomly, we selected counties that were next to each other in the data.
# This picked counties in the same state more often that not, and created means that didn't represent the whole country.
# This is the danger of not using random sampling -- you end up with samples that don't reflect the entire population.
# This gives you a distribution that isn't normal.
