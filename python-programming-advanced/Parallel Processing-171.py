## 2. Using Mutable Values for Changing Information ##


class Counter():
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1
    def get_count(self):

        counter.increment()

## 3. Multithreading Multiple Processes ##

import threading

counter = Counter()
count_thread = threading.Thread(target=count_up_100000, args=[counter])
count_thread.start()
count_thread.join()
counter = Counter()
count_thread = threading.Thread(target=count_up_100000, args=[counter])
count_thread.start()
count_thread.join()

print(after_join)

## 4. Determinism of Program Results ##

import threading

def conduct_trial():
    counter = Counter()
    count_thread = threading.Thread(target=count_up_100000, args=[counter])
    count_thread.start()
    # Take measurement here
    
    count_thread.join()
def conduct_trial():
    counter = Counter()
    count_thread = threading.Thread(target=count_up_100000, args=[counter])

    return intermediate_value

trial1 = conduct_trial()
print(trial1)
trial2 = conduct_trial()

## 5. Using Locks to Enforce Determinism in Multithreading ##

import threading

    for i in range(10000):
        for i in range(10):
            counter.increment()

    return intermediate_value

trial1 = conduct_trial()
print(trial1)
trial2 = conduct_trial()
print(trial2)

print(trial3)
def count_up_100000(counter, lock):
    for i in range(10000):
        lock.acquire()
        for i in range(10):
            counter.increment()
        lock.release()

def conduct_trial():
    counter = Counter()
    lock = threading.Lock()
    count_thread = threading.Thread(target=count_up_100000, args=[counter, lock])
    count_thread.start()
    lock.acquire()
    intermediate_value = counter.get_count()
    lock.release()

    return intermediate_value

## 6. Counting in Two Steps ##

def count_up_100000(counter):

        counter.increment()

def count_up_100000(counter):

counter = Counter()

## 7. Counting Once on Two Different Threads ##

import threading

    for i in range(100000):

    count_thread2.start()

    # Join the threads here

    final_count = counter.get_count()
    return final_count
def count_up_100000(counter):
    for i in range(100000):
        
        counter.increment()

    # Join the threads here
    count_thread1.join()
    count_thread2.join()
