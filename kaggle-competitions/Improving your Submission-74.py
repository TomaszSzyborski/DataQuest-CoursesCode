## 3. Implementing a Random Forest ##

from sklearn import cross_validation
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked"]

# Initialize our algorithm with the default paramters
# n_estimators is the number of trees we want to make
# min_samples_split is the minimum number of rows we need to make a split
# min_samples_leaf is the minimum number of samples we can have at the place where a tree branch ends (the bottom points of the tree)
alg = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=10, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)
# Compute the accuracy score for all of the cross validation folds; this is much simpler than what we did before
kf = cross_validation.KFold(titanic.shape[0], n_folds=3, random_state=1)
scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg, titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"], cv=kf)

# Take the mean of the scores (because we have one for each fold)
print(scores.mean())

## 4. Tuning Parameters to Improve Accuracy ##

alg = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=50, min_samples_split=4, min_samples_leaf=2)
# Compute the accuracy score for all the cross-validation folds; this is much simpler than what we did before
kf = cross_validation.KFold(titanic.shape[0], 3, random_state=1)
scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg, titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"], cv=kf)

# Take the mean of the scores (because we have one for each fold)
print(scores.mean())

## 5. Generating New Features With .apply ##

# Generating a familysize column
titanic["FamilySize"] = titanic["SibSp"] + titanic["Parch"]

# The .apply method generates a new series
titanic["NameLength"] = titanic["Name"].apply(lambda x: len(x))

## 7. Generating a Feature for Family Groups ##

import operator

# A dictionary mapping family name to ID
family_id_mapping = {}

# A function to get the ID for a particular row
def get_family_id(row):
    # Find the last name by splitting on a comma
    last_name = row["Name"].split(",")[0]
    # Create the family ID
    family_id = "{0}{1}".format(last_name, row["FamilySize"])
    # Look up the ID in the mapping
    if family_id not in family_id_mapping:
        if len(family_id_mapping) == 0:
            current_id = 1
        else:
            # Get the maximum ID from the mapping, and add 1 to it if we don't have an ID
            current_id = (max(family_id_mapping.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))[1] + 1)
        family_id_mapping[family_id] = current_id
    return family_id_mapping[family_id]

# Get the family IDs with the apply method
family_ids = titanic.apply(get_family_id, axis=1)

# There are a lot of family IDs, so we'll compress all of the families with less than three members into one code
family_ids[titanic["FamilySize"] < 3] = -1

# Print the count of each unique ID
print(pandas.value_counts(family_ids))

titanic["FamilyId"] = family_ids

## 8. Identifying the Best Features to Use ##

import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked", "FamilySize", "Title", "FamilyId", "NameLength"]

# Perform feature selection
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=5)
selector.fit(titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"])

# Get the raw p-values for each feature, and transform them from p-values into scores
scores = -np.log10(selector.pvalues_)

# Plot the scores  
# Do you see how "Pclass", "Sex", "Title", and "Fare" are the best features?
plt.bar(range(len(predictors)), scores)
plt.xticks(range(len(predictors)), predictors, rotation='vertical')
plt.show()

# Pick only the four best features
predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Fare", "Title"]

alg = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=50, min_samples_split=8, min_samples_leaf=4)
# Compute the accuracy score for all the cross-validation folds; this is much simpler than what we did before
scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg, titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"], cv=3)

# Take the mean of the scores (because we have one for each fold)
print(scores.mean())

## 10. Making Predictions With Multiple Classifiers ##

from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
import numpy as np

# The algorithms we want to ensemble
# We're using the more linear predictors for the logistic regression, and everything with the gradient boosting classifier
algorithms = [
    [GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=25, max_depth=3), ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "Embarked", "FamilySize", "Title", "FamilyId"]],
    [LogisticRegression(random_state=1), ["Pclass", "Sex", "Fare", "FamilySize", "Title", "Age", "Embarked"]]
]

# Initialize the cross-validation folds
kf = KFold(titanic.shape[0], n_folds=3, random_state=1)

predictions = []
for train, test in kf:
    train_target = titanic["Survived"].iloc[train]
    full_test_predictions = []
    # Make predictions for each algorithm on each fold
    for alg, predictors in algorithms:
        # Fit the algorithm on the training data
        alg.fit(titanic[predictors].iloc[train,:], train_target)
        # Select and predict on the test fold 
        # We need to use .astype(float) to convert the dataframe to all floats and avoid an sklearn error
        test_predictions = alg.predict_proba(titanic[predictors].iloc[test,:].astype(float))[:,1]
        full_test_predictions.append(test_predictions)
    # Use a simple ensembling scheme&#8212;just average the predictions to get the final classification
    test_predictions = (full_test_predictions[0] + full_test_predictions[1]) / 2
    # Any value over .5 is assumed to be a 1 prediction, and below .5 is a 0 prediction
    test_predictions[test_predictions <= .5] = 0
    test_predictions[test_predictions > .5] = 1
    predictions.append(test_predictions)

# Put all the predictions together into one array
predictions = np.concatenate(predictions, axis=0)

# Compute accuracy by comparing to the training data
accuracy = sum(predictions[predictions == titanic["Survived"]]) / len(predictions)
print(accuracy)

## 11. Matching Our Changes on the Test Set ##

# First, we'll add titles to the test set
titles = titanic_test["Name"].apply(get_title)
# We're adding the Dona title to the mapping, because it's in the test set, but not the training set
title_mapping = {"Mr": 1, "Miss": 2, "Mrs": 3, "Master": 4, "Dr": 5, "Rev": 6, "Major": 7, "Col": 7, "Mlle": 8, "Mme": 8, "Don": 9, "Lady": 10, "Countess": 10, "Jonkheer": 10, "Sir": 9, "Capt": 7, "Ms": 2, "Dona": 10}
for k,v in title_mapping.items():
    titles[titles == k] = v
titanic_test["Title"] = titles
# Check the counts of each unique title
print(pandas.value_counts(titanic_test["Title"]))

# Now we add the family size column
titanic_test["FamilySize"] = titanic_test["SibSp"] + titanic_test["Parch"]

# Now we can add family IDs
# We'll use the same IDs we used earlier
print(family_id_mapping)

family_ids = titanic_test.apply(get_family_id, axis=1)
family_ids[titanic_test["FamilySize"] < 3] = -1
titanic_test["FamilyId"] = family_ids
titanic_test["NameLength"] = titanic_test["Name"].apply(lambda x: len(x))

## 12. Predicting on the Test Set ##

predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "Embarked", "FamilySize", "Title", "FamilyId"]

algorithms = [
    [GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=25, max_depth=3), predictors],
    [LogisticRegression(random_state=1), ["Pclass", "Sex", "Fare", "FamilySize", "Title", "Age", "Embarked"]]
]

full_predictions = []
for alg, predictors in algorithms:
    # Fit the algorithm using the full training data.
    alg.fit(titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"])
    # Predict using the test dataset.  We have to convert all the columns to floats to avoid an error
    predictions = alg.predict_proba(titanic_test[predictors].astype(float))[:,1]
    full_predictions.append(predictions)

# The gradient boosting classifier generates better predictions, so we weight it higher
predictions = (full_predictions[0] * 3 + full_predictions[1]) / 4
predictions[predictions <= .5] = 0
predictions[predictions > .5] = 1
predictions = predictions.astype(int)
submission = pandas.DataFrame({
        "PassengerId": titanic_test["PassengerId"],
        "Survived": predictions
    })
