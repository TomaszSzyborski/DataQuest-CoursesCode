## 3. Base Cases ##

def factorial(n):
    # Check the base case
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

factorial1 = factorial(1)
factorial5 = factorial(5)
factorial25 = factorial(25)

## 5. Fibonacci ##

# Add your function below
def fib(n):
    # Check the base case
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

fib1 = fib(1)
fib5 = fib(5)
fib25 = fib(25)

## 7. Exercise: Find the Length of a Linked List ##

# First person's name
first_item = people.head().get_data()

# Getting the length of the linked list using iteration
def length_iterative(ls):
    count = 0
    while not ls.is_empty():
        count = count + 1
        ls = ls.tail()
    return count

# Getting the length of the linked list using recursion
def length_recursive(ls):
    if ls.is_empty():
        return 0
    return 1 + length_recursive(ls.tail())
people_length = length_recursive(people)
